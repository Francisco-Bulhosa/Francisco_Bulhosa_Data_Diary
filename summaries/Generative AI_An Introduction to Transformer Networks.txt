Summary: Transformers are a powerful neural network architecture designed to handle complex language tasks like translation and question answering while managing long-range dependencies. They use an encoder-decoder structure with self-attention and feed-forward layers to process data efficiently. Transformers resolve the vanishing gradient problem and enable faster training speed compared to traditional RNN models. They work by converting textual data into numerical values through word embeddings and utilize the self-attention mechanism to detect distant data relationships. Transformers are used in various natural language processing and computer vision applications, such as language translation, sentiment analysis, image classification, and object detection. Their applications have been adopted by companies like Google and Facebook for tasks like Google Translate and image classification. Transformers' ability to handle large datasets and their encoder-decoder architecture make them effective tools for a wide range of tasks in the field of deep learning.
