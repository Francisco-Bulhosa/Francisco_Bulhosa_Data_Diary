Summary: Principal Component Regression (PCR) is a regression technique that uses principal components as predictor variables instead of original features. It works in three steps: applying PCA to generate principal components, keeping the top k components, and fitting a linear regression model on these components. PCR reduces overfitting and multicollinearity, but it doesn't act as a feature selection method and may sacrifice explainability. The PCA transformation is unsupervised, and there's no guarantee that components with high variance will predict the target well. A step-by-step Python implementation of PCR on a wine quality dataset is provided, showing how to determine the number of principal components and evaluate the model's performance. PCR can be beneficial in high-dimensional data with multicollinearity, but it has its limitations.
