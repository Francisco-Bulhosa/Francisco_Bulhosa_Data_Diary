Summary: This tutorial explores different LSTM variations for text classification on the IMDb movie reviews dataset. The classic LSTM uses word embeddings and a dense layer for classification. The deep LSTM stacks two LSTMs on top of each other. The bidirectional LSTM runs two LSTMs in different directions and concatenates their outputs. The hybrid CNN LSTM combines convolutional and LSTM layers for faster processing. These LSTM variations are applicable to various types of text and languages, and larger datasets will be used in future tutorials for further exploration.
